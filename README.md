# Three.js Project: Animated Text

A clearly explained, simple 3D web project using Three.js to create a dynamic, interactive text animation with a outline effect.

## Features

- **3D Text with Glass Material**: The project generates text using a custom font, styled with a transparent, glass-like material.
- **Outline Animation**: A dynamic outline effect around the text is created using dashed lines that animate over time, giving the text a unique, stylized look.
